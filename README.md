# Lab-31-d49

## Project: todo-app

## Problem Domain

Implement the React Context API to define global settings that can be accessed by multiple components. Create a context provider that manages application display settings, and provide it at the application level. Add default values to the context provider's state, including the number of items to display, a boolean to hide completed items, and a default sort word. Consume and use the context values throughout the components, including the <List /> component, which now shows a maximum of three items per screen by default and uses the Mantine Pagination component to allow users to navigate a list of items. Also add the ability to hide completed items in the list by default.
